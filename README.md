This repo has some old apps from when this idea was originally formulated with Automator in macOS.

Since then it has been converted into a shell script and now has an installer and uninstaller.

The current best version of the app is found in "Final App." You will also find a .dmg file here with an installer/uninstaller.

This can only be run on macOS.
