Welcome to the Mac Startup Sound Installer.

This app implements a script and launch agent that plays any sound bite of your choice at login. Use it to have a laugh that your Mac plays something like an old Windows login chime when you log in or something.

Simply run the Startup Sound Installer app and all the necessary scripts will be installed where they need to go.
Note that this app does not actually live in the Applications folder, but is simply a Script and LaunchAgent in the user's Library.

To uninstall, simply run the Uninstaller in the .dmg you downloaded to originally install this app.
